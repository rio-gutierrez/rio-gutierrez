### Hi, I'm Mario 👋 Thank you for visiting my profile!

I was born and raised in Cuba 🇨🇺 and have also lived in the US :us: and the UK :uk: I love learning about new cultures and traveling; I have visited more than 30 countries 🌍 and I expect the list to grow 😉

My academic background is in both pure and applied/computational mathematics ♾ as well as in theoretical physics ⚛️ I am an ardent tech enthusiast 👨🏻‍💻 and I enjoy spending as much time as possible writing codes. I envision myself working for the tech industry as soon as I finish my studies.  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on setting up initial data for a system of more than two black holes
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tech-relevant languages/frameworks (JavaScript, React, Node, Java, etc), as well as improving my Italian :it:
- 📨 How to reach me: Drop me an email at gutierrez.m101587@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of sports ⚽️ and of video games 🎮 (PCMR for life 😝)
